# Smoking Cessation Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This notebook aims to address the challenge of predicting an individual's smoking status using bio-signals through machine learning techniques. Smoking remains a significant public health concern globally, and predicting smoking cessation outcomes can greatly aid in improving cessation interventions and outcomes.

## Objectives
- Conduct data analyses including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
- Perform feature engineering and preprocessing to extract meaningful features that positively impact model accuracy and performance.
- Implement ensemble methods including bagging, boosting, and random forests to leverage well-engineered features and models for improved predictive accuracy and robustness.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search and randomized search to optimize model performance.
- Develop a final machine learning system with the best performance for smoking cessation prediction.

## Problem Statement
Despite concerted efforts, smoking remains a significant contributor to various health complications and preventable illnesses globally. This notebook aims to utilize machine learning to predict an individual's smoking status using bio-signals. The predictive model will consider multiple factors such as nicotine dependency, carbon monoxide levels, daily cigarette consumption, age of smoking initiation, previous quit attempts, emotional well-being, personality traits, and motivation to quit.

## Assignment Details
1. **Data Analysis**:
    - Conduct univariate analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of individual features.
    - Perform bivariate analysis to examine relationships between pairs of features.
    - Conduct multivariate analysis to assess complex interactions among multiple features.
2. **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing**:
    - Employ techniques for feature engineering based on insights from data analysis.
    - Explore feature impacts through hands-on exercises involving feature manipulation.
3. **Ensemble Methods**:
    - Implement bagging using bootstrapping to train multiple models independently and combine their predictions.
    - Implement boosting to build a sequence of models correcting errors made by previous ones.
    - Implement random forests using DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn to combine multiple decision trees.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Utilize grid search to exhaustively search through a specified parameter grid for the best combination of hyperparameters.
