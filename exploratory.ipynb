    "Univariate analysis is a statistical analysis technique that focuses on examining and summarizing the characteristics and distribution of a single variable at a time. In the provided code, the univariate analysis can be performed on each column of the dataset separately to gain insights about individual variables. Here are some potential insights that can be derived from univariate analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types: By examining the data types of the columns, you can determine whether they are numeric (continuous or discrete) or categorical (ordinal or nominal). This information helps in choosing appropriate statistical measures and visualization techniques for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary statistics: Univariate analysis provides summary statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each variable. These statistics give an overview of the central tendency, spread, and distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution visualization: Histograms, box plots, and density plots can be used to visualize the distribution of numeric variables. These plots provide insights into the shape, skewness, and presence of outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value counts: For categorical variables, value counts can be calculated to determine the frequency or proportion of each category. This helps in understanding the distribution and prevalence of different categories within the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values: Univariate analysis allows you to identify missing values in each variable. By examining the percentage of missing values or using visualization techniques, you can assess the extent of missingness and decide on appropriate strategies for handling missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Univariate analysis can help in identifying outliers in numeric variables. Box plots or statistical methods such as z-scores or interquartile range (IQR) can be used to detect and investigate potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness and Kurtosis: Univariate analysis can provide insights into the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution for each variable. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution, while kurtosis measures the tail heaviness or peakedness of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature importance: Univariate analysis can help in assessing the importance or relevance of each variable in relation to the target variable. This can be done by examining the correlation, information gain, or other statistical measures between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights gained from univariate analysis help in understanding the characteristics, patterns, and potential issues associated with each individual variable, which forms the basis for further exploratory data analysis and feature engineering in machine learning tasks."
